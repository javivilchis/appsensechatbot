    <h1>Reimagining Content Creation with Veo 3</h1>
    <h2>Unveiling the Power of AI - November 20, 2021, by Senior Blogger</h2>
    
    <p>In a world dominated by visual content, staying ahead of the curve is paramount. This is exactly what Googleâ€™s DeepMind has achieved with their latest generative AI model, Veo 3. A revolution in storytelling, Veo 3 opens up new dimensions for creating cinematic clips, scenes, and stories - right at your fingertips.</p>
    
    <p>Getting started with Veo 3 is a breeze. Just pick a clip, add it to the <strong>Scenebuilder</strong> and let the power of AI handle the rest. However, note that the Scenebuilder resets when you leave your project, so don't forget to check all your crafted clips in the clips view. And don't worry, soon you'll be able to save your state in Scenebuilder!</p>
    
    <p>Once your masterpiece is ready, it's simply a matter of downloading it. Need to share your creation? <strong><a href="https://google.com" title="Google AI' target='_blank'>Upscale your clips to 1080p</a></strong> or download as GIFs for quick and easy sharing.</p>
    
    <p>There's more to Veo 3 than meets the eye. Depending on your needs, you can choose between three model tiers: Fast, Quality, and Highest Quality. But be aware, some features are exclusive to specific models. In case you try to use a feature not available in your selected tier, Veo 3 smartly defaults you to a compatible one.</p>
    
    <p>But what's a good video without clear subjects? That's where <strong>Ingredients to Video</strong> comes in. Adding a subject or product reference makes it easier for the AI to capture what you care about. And with Veo 3, you can point to up to three subjects, locations, or objects in your clip.</p>

    <p>Looking to iterate on your prompt? Gemini, Google AI's most capable model, comes to your rescue. Just send your prompt, image, or even video to Gemini and witness the AI magic unfold.</p>

    <p>Perhaps the most exciting feature of Veo 3 is its <strong>audio co-generation</strong>. You can now create a more immersive narrative by adding sound effects, background noises, and even speech to your videos. Sheer genius, wouldn't you agree?</p>

    <p>Please note, however, that as Veo 3 is continuously evolving, some features like first + last frame, camera controls, extend, or Ingredients to Video are yet to be compatible and would default you back to Veo 2 models.</p>

    <p>As the future of storytelling unfolds, we're working tirelessly to bring Flow to as many people as possible. Keep an eye out for new updates and don't forget to share your thoughts and feedback to help us grow further! Stick around for more!</p>
