    <h1>AI: A Force to Be Reckoned With in the World of Finance</h1>
    <h2>Insights from the Heart of the AI Revolution, May 14, 2025. By AI Blogger.</h2>
    <p>Futurists and innovators have been envisioning applications of AI in different sectors.

Today, I delve deep into the way AI is transforming the finance world.</p>
    <p>The bridge between AI and finance became more prominent when a team of analysts at <strong>Rittenhouse Research</strong> recently gave GLXY a strong buy rating, focusing on its imminent shift from BTC mining to AI technology</a>.<a href="https://www.rittenhouseresearch.com" title="Rittenhouse Research" target="_blank"></a></p>

    <p>The AI investment wave received a massive boost with the passing of the GENIUS Act. Notably, at least <strong>60 senators</strong> afforded their votes towards this monumental act. The bill could potentially open floodgates for further funding and research in the AI field. This could parcel out to lucrative opportunities for companies looking to expand into this arena or start-ups looking to make a mark.</p>

    <p>The undulating tides of the Cryptocurrency world have proven unfazed by Moody's U.S. debt downgrade as they reversed their early losses. This shows the strength and resilience of AI-powered fintech organizations, establishing their own foothold, independent from traditional financial markets.</p>

    <p>Several exciting on-chain metrics seem to indicate waning momentum as Bitcoin tries to reach its record high $109,000. This slowing momentum isn't a result of declining interest, but could rather be indicative of a maturing market. As AI embeds itself into blockchain technology, we might begin to see more consistent, predictable, and reliable patterns in the crypto market.</p>

    <p>In the realm of blockchain, another eye-catching development was a proposal from Ethereumâ€™s co-founder, aiming to trim costs for node operators by running lightweight nodes void of the entire blockchain. Leveraging AI to automate and optimize this task can lead to significantly lower costs and increased efficiency.</p>

    <p>Apart from these, an intriguing development is the launch of the Singaporean dollar-pegged stablecoin, XSGD, on the XRP Ledger. StraitsX, in a bid to meet the surging demand for regulated multi-chain stablecoins in cross-border payments, showcased how AI and blockchain could be used to create monetary stability in the digital realm.</p>

    <p>Not just confined to trading or investments, AI is increasingly influencing decision-making in the healthcare finance domain. AI enthusiast <strong>Dimitris Bertsimas</strong> co-authored a book exploring how data analytics is driving decisions and outcomes in health care.</p>

    <p>Thus, we witness AI's fingers reaching out, intertwining with the strings in the finance world, from Fintech to Cryptocurrency to investments, and even more. It would be shortsighted to ignore these signals that show the unmistakable influence of AI and how it's shaping the future of the financial world.</p>
